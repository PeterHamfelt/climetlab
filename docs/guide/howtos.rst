How to install CliMetLab?
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install climetlab

See the :ref:`installing instructions <installing>` for more details.

How to access data?
-------------------

As CliMetLab only provides a few demo datasets.
To access a dataset with :py:func:`load_dataset`, the relevant plugin
must be installed. See :ref:`accessing_data`.


How to help others to use my data?
----------------------------------

Creating a CliMetLab plugin can be a solution to share some code along
with the dataset that you are publishing/using.
See the :ref:`plugin documentation <contributing-overview>`.

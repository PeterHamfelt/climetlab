Overview
========

*"CliMetLab provides a common place to share code used in the Weather and
Climate community to do preprocess data, plot it, and include additional
tools, especially for machine leaning purposes."*

The is the **developer guide** part of the CliMetLab documentation, which is
split as follow:

- *Getting started*: General introduction with the main idea described there.
- *User guide*: This is the part you should read if you are using CliMetLab
  and plugins developed by others.
- *Contributor guide*: describes how to create plugins (or YAML files) to add
  data and functionalities to CliMetLab, to make it available to the users
  above. In order to avoid rewriting the same code over and over, consider
  distributing it, the design of CliMetLab allows to do this with plugins.
- **Developers guide**: Please refer to this part either if you are willing to
  develop further CliMetLab or if you want to achieve something that is not
  possible with the current plugin framework.
- *Reference*: The reference documentation of the CliMetLab API and description
  of its internal architecture.
